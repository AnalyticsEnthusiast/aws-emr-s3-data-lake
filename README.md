### Project Overview

<br>

<p>Demand for analytics within sparkify has grown tremendously over the last quarter which has prompted for a new requirement. A data lake is to be built to accomodate sparkify's growing user base. The data lake will use AWS S3 as the storage layer while ETL processing will run pyspark jobs on AWS EMR, which will then write clean parquet files to the data lake. Parquet files will improve read performance and should make day to day analytics much quicker. A serverless tool like AWS Athena could be then used to read the source parquet files to peform day to day analytics. Just as a POC, a simple pyspark job is run to prove that files have been written correctly but AWS Athena would be a much better option. </p>

### Git Action Trigger on this project

<br> 

<p>A github action trigger has been set up on this repository to automatically push code out to S3 at s3://sparkify-etl-code-df/. This bucket is public and should be accessible.</p>

<br>


#### Project set-up

<br>

<p>The project pipeline is designed to be executed from within an EMR instance on AWS. The instance must have the following properties:</p>

1. Region: us-west-2 (To minimise geographical distance between EMR, source S3 and destination S3 buckets)

2. Nodes: Single master node and 2 worker nodes running emr version emr-5.28.0. Instance type = m5.xlarge.

3. Applications to be installed: Spark

4. Access to source code: Code is placed on S3 for EMR to use: In this project I'm using "sparkify-etl-code-df" (This bucket is public)


<p>For convenience, the script "EMR-with-bootstrap.sh" is a wrapper for the aws cli which executes the following command</p>


```

    aws emr create-cluster \
    --name "${CLUSTER_NAME}" \
    --use-default-roles \
    --release-label emr-5.28.0 \
    --instance-count 3 \
    --applications Name=Spark  \
    --ec2-attributes KeyName="${KEY_NAME}",SubnetId="${SUBNET_NAME}" \
    --instance-type m5.xlarge \
    --profile "${PROFILE_NAME}" \
    --bootstrap-actions Path="s3://sparkify-etl-code-df/bootstrap.sh",Args=${BUCKET_NAME}

```


<p>You simply need to provide the various input parameters to create the EMR instance. If you are using a different code source then you'll need to change the etl bucket name. EMR script can be run from the command line:</p>

```

# ./EMR-with-bootstrap.sh -h
Usage ./EMR-with-bootstrap.sh [-n|name] [-k|key] [-s|subnet] [-p|profile] [-b|bucket Name] [-h|help]

# ./EMR-with-bootstrap.sh -n "etl-cluster" -k "etl-key" -s "subnet-9f5738c2" -p "admin" -b "sparkify-data-lake-df"

```

1. [-n] - Name of cluster

2. [-k] - Key-pair created for connecting to EMR

3. [-s] - Subnet into which the EMR will be created

4. [-p] - Profile credentials for AWS user (Must be created beforehand)

5. [-b] - Output bucket Name for parquet files (I have used sparkify-data-lake-df)

<br>

#### EMR Environment Set-up and ETL execution

<p>The bootstrap script should set up most of the environment variables required to run the etl.py script. Check the dl.cfg to make sure the destination bucket is provided. Source Code is pulled from a public bucket called <b>sparkify-etl-code-df</b> otherwise, you'll need to clone the git repo onto the master node and set up by running <b>./bootstrap.sh "bucket_name"</b>. "bucket_name" is the destination bucket where you would like to push the output parquet files.</p>

<br>

<p>You can run the etl.py pipeline by submitting the code from the masternode like so:</p>

```

# /usr/bin/spark-submit --master yarn ./etl.py

```

<p>If everything works, the pyspark job should take approx <b>15-20min</b>. You should see output directories, one for each table under the destination bucket.</p>

<br>

### Schema Design

<p>The data model is essentially a star schema that follows the same structure as the existing DWH on redshift. The main difference is that the data is not stored on a database system but as raw data on S3 as parquet files. There are still four dimension tables and a single fact table. Data must be loaded into spark or analysed using a tool such as AWS Athena in order to perform queries on the data. ETL Processing will be done on EMR using pyspark jobs. The instances can be shut down after completion using --auto-terminate which will help save costs of performing ETL on the data.</p> 

<br>

| Table Name    | Description                                                                   |
|--------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| dim_user      | Information relating to users, both free users and subscribers                |
| dim_artist    | List of tracked artists within sparkify                                       |
| dim_song      | List of tracked Songs within sparkify                                         |
| dim_time      | Time broken out by week, day, weekday, hour etc for data aggregation          |
| fact_songPlay | Fact table containing user events, documents what songs are being listened to |                                        

<br>

### Verify Data Lake with Sample Query

<br>

<p>The script sample-query.py is a simple analytical query which helps verify that parquet files were written correctly to S3.</p>

<p>The query will list top ten most active users within sparkify logs</p>

```

    SELECT
        u.first_name,
        u.last_name,
        sp.user_id,
        COUNT(DISTINCT sp.session_id) as session_count
    FROM songplay sp
     JOIN users u
    ON u.user_id = sp.user_id
    GROUP BY 
        u.first_name,
        u.last_name,
        sp.user_id
    ORDER BY session_count DESC
    LIMIT 10

```

<p>Ouput should look like this:</p>

| first_name  | last_name  | user_id  | session_count |
|------------:|:----------:|:--------:|:-------------:|
| Chloe       | Cuevas     | 49       | 28            |
| Tegan       | Levine     | 80       | 22            |
| Kate        | Harrell    | 97       | 13            |
| Lily        | Koch       | 15       | 11            |
| Aleena      | Kirby      | 44       | 10            |
| Ava         | Robinson   | 50       | 8             |
| Mohammad    | Rodriguez  | 88       | 8             |    
| Matthew     | Jones      | 36       | 8             |
| Layla       | Griffin    | 24       | 7             |
| Jacqueline  | Lynch      | 29       | 7             |


<p>Output should be sent to a folder <b>query_output/</b> under the destination bucket. The file will be in csv format.</p>
